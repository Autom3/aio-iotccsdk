# Getting started with Jupyter Notebooks in Azure
Setup a NotebookVM in Azure Machine Learning Workspace. The quickstart setup instructions are located [here](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/quickstart-run-cloud-notebook?branch=release-build-amls).

### Clone this repo to your Notebook VM
From the Notebook VM launch the Jupyter web interface. Click New -> Terminal. You will get the bash prompt. 
You can use regular `git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/vision-ai-developer-kit` command line commands to clone this repository into desired folder.

Select a notebook in `machine-learning-reference\notebooks` to run it. Set the kernel to **Python 3.6 - AzureML**.
